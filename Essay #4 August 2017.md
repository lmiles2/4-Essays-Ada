##**4. Tell us about a time you made a mistake that you learned a lot from. If you encountered the situation again, what would you do differently?**

Undercommit.  Over Deliver.  Overcommit – you get fun, tons of it.   This is now my mantra. I prefer to commit to a few carefully considered things and excel at them rather than taking on many things some better than others but all requiring a lot of commitment.  With this attitude that requires me to be more selective, realistic and have a sixth sense on what I will be able to contribute to achieve.

At work with Dignity, my manager raised my sales quota to $30,000 in one month.  I would become #10 salesperson in the market with $48k of sales in one month, but at that time I was bringing in $20,000 only.  After my success in my business LMCreativeCommunications.  That summer, I was approached to raise money by five (5) organizations:  Peace Day Broadcast, Sigma Pi Phi/Zeta Phi Beta Stars, International Sponsorship Chair UFSC Board and a new Beacon Hill Gallery/Theater Fundraising Chair.  At that time, I was holding a position as chair, UFSC 3rd Annual Scholarship Dinner and Awards Show.  

The situation required prioritization, organization and strategy.  I met with each group to determine whether they were at the stage where they could be helped by my expertise.  Some were startups others well established.  There were synergies where I could benefit their organization, but I also determined whether the opportunity would benefit me.  I chose to focus on my new quota in sales by increasing my calls to 80 cold calls a day which scheduled 8 intense sales meetings per week for me.  In my community activities, I chose to remain Chair of the UFSC Annual Scholarship Dinner and Awards Show as well as take on a role as Corporate Sponsorship Chair of the Peace Day Broadcast.

Although I was intrigued by the Gallery as an interesting space to work with, I knew I did not have the working capacity at the time for the International Chair of the Sponsorship Committee for the International UFSC Board.  I preferred to do a good job as Chair of the Scholarship and Awards Dinner as there were many aspects involved.  My decision was based on the fact that in finishing the role for which I had committed to and was the central decision maker and coordinator would require more integrity than bailing on the role for something higher in the organization when I wouldn’t be able to attend the event I would be securing sponsorships for which was in Kansas City that year.  The Sigma Pi Phi/Zeta Phi Beta Stars while backed by significant organizations needed more development organizationally and I provided a plan for the steps needed to do this rather than simply declining their offer.  

The Peace Day Broadcast was a 24-hour Broadcast on Peace Day focusing on subjects related to the UN 8 Millennium Development Goals.  Eight universal goals that would bring about significant change worldwide featuring such goals as providing clean drinking water to all communities internationally to educating girls from developing companies who prohibited it.  The Broadcast was in it’s second year and had a national team based in Portland, Ore of successful broadcast and nonprofit who all had ties to the UN.  The UN had sanctioned the Broadcast and they had raised money in sponsorships the previous year.  With the subject, I would be contributing to change on a grand scale by raising awareness of these universal solutions.  All the professionals committed significantly.  The Broadcast related to the media portion of my background.  I was excited to be presenting Sponsorships rather than fundraising using avenues of grants through corporations, government or individuals.  The role had more splash to it for me and it was more dynamic.

As Chair of the UFSC Scholarship and Awards dinner, I created and managed budgets related to the dinner, interfaced with venue event planners securing the venue through contract negotiation, I decided menus, decided which avenue was best to sell tickets by researching the online service provider, focused on how the room was to be displayed, determined the no host bar, and devised the program order.
There were many meetings at the Marriott on the Waterfront, The World Trade Center which was our venue and restaurants.  I enjoyed the role and kept things on track even though my oversight was performed in my free time.

For the Peace Day broadcast, I determined Corporate Sponsorship Levels and their associated benefits. I determined key players who I or the other board members had contacts with.  I also composed sponsorship request letters targeted to the organization’s interest.  Reached out to the organizations through emails, letters, phone calls, sponsorship request submissions, and meetings.

With superhuman efficiency, I balanced and engaged in all aspects needed for the various projects and organizations always keeping my own job as the focus.  It was phenomenal what I was able to accomplish.  Both organizations successfully produced their initiatives and my sales increased.  By careful juggling, willingness to commit, scheduling and tracking tools as well as a roll up the sleeves attitude with the right communication and focus propelled me to success in the roles I chose to assume.  Through the experience of simultaneously working with these entities, I realized that a true determination of one’s strengths and the role and capacities you can provide bear out when there are several tasks to complete and requests from many organizations.  Although I am happy about the roles I decided to commit to, I can’t help but wonder what would have been done differently had I chosen differently.  Now I carefully prioritize.  I only take on what I can do.
